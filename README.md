## Notes & shoutouts

This first started with figuring out how to make handle bars work in Ember followed by actions. Then after getting the CSS the way I wanted, I ran into a long issue of figuring out why my total value would return in such a strange way until I realized that it wasn't adding values properly but instead it concatenate them. Overall, putting everything else together was fine.
